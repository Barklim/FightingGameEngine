This is (going to be) a determenistic fighting game engine based on a text DSL. 

the character's Stack based virtual machine is implemented, just need to write a compiler to generate bytecode for domain language stuff ( currently writing state scripts in bytecode lol, see example char definition )
state serialization + simulation  is up next (gotta be determenistic for that sweet GGPO netcode baybee)
